# ALX Backend JavaScript Specialization Project: Introduction to TypeScript

Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Backend Specialization project, focusing on TypeScript. This directory contains a series of tasks aimed at deepening understanding of TypeScript and its fundamental concepts. Below are the primary learning objectives for this project:

## Learning Objectives

1. **Basic Types in TypeScript**: Understand the fundamental data types in TypeScript, such as string, number, boolean, etc.

2. **Interfaces, Classes, and Functions**: Grasp the concepts of interfaces and classes in TypeScript, along with their usage in defining custom types and structures. Also, understand how to work with functions in TypeScript.

3. **Working with the DOM and TypeScript**: Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using TypeScript for browser-based applications.

4. **Generic Types**: Understand the concept of generic types in TypeScript and how they enable writing reusable and flexible code.

5. **Namespaces**: Explore how namespaces help in organizing code and avoiding naming conflicts in TypeScript projects.

6. **Merging Declarations**: Learn about declaration merging in TypeScript and how it enables extending existing types and interfaces.

7. **Using Ambient Namespace to Import External Libraries**: Understand the usage of ambient namespaces to import and use external libraries in TypeScript projects.

8. **Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript**: Gain insights into nominal typing in TypeScript, which allows distinguishing between types based on their names rather than just their structure.
